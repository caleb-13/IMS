About the Project
This project demonstrates object-oriented design, Windows Forms development, and UI interaction logic.

While the current version of this project meets all required functionality,
I plan to make further improvements to the codebase for maintainability and scalability. In particular:

    Refactor repetitive logic across forms (such as DataGridView setup) into a reusable helper class to reduce redundancy and simplify future updates.
